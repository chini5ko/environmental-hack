- https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00722 [ reduce stress ]

## Dataset

1. Multiple Sensors
   - CO2, Dewpoint, Relative Humidity, Temperature, External Conditions 

## Challenge
1. Detect anomalies
   - real & synthetic anomalies [ more details to follow ]
   - https://www.anodot.com/blog/quick-guide-different-types-outliers/
   
2. Interesting Behavior / Top Escalation
   - Looking for good idea/story/hypothesis for what is happening in the data
       [ e.g. interesting behavior -- most populous day, power outage ]

   - We'll verify plausability [ w/ help of Claire Woodward, horticulturalist at the Amazon Spheres ]

3. Visually Communicate Status
   - We will accept any format PDF, powerpoint, email text/html, notebook widget, webapp 

## Summary of the Hackathon by @Chini5ko 
During this hackathon my team and I designed a simple UI to manage the different type of sensors that are located in the Amazon Sphere in Seattle, using the CoreUI template. 

Most of the work I did was to modify the template to suit my needs to display a simplistic UI and providing a scipt to filter the different type of anomaly in the sensors. 

My team was in charge of analyzing the data provided by AWS.

You can plya around with the design in the following link :
